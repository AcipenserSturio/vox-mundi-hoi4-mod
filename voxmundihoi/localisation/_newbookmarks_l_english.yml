 VOX_MUNDI_NAME:0 "Gathering Storm"
 VOX_MUNDI_DESC:0 "The people of Dacia are about to rebel against the opressive regime that has built up in their nation. Dacia's mortal enemies, including the Ferraro-Lombard Empire and the Moravian Union see this as an opportunity to strike against the democracies and restore their respective empires. The old balance of power that has benefitted the democratic powers such as Castille and Valois is about to get thrown away. Will the democracies be able to restore it? Or will the world be administered by communists and fascists after this Worldwide Sixth Great War?"
 CLN_VOX_MUNDI_DESC:0 "After being exiled to the New World Crioch Lochlann Nova tried not to participate in any major European conflicts. But now that dictatorships are planning to take over the entirety of Europe and possibly the world, will CLN act to stop that?"
 CAS_VOX_MUNDI_DESC:0 "The world's greatest power has depended on its allies for a whole century, but with Dacia about to fall into civil disorder, the balance of power allows Castille's enemies to redraw the map of Europe the way they want to. Will Castille's power be enough to hold off the fascist and communist regimes of Europe this time?"
 GWR_VOX_MUNDI_DESC:0 "Gudian Workers' Republic hasn't fully recovered from the communist revolution yet and lost in the latest war against Moravia, but maybe it's time to come to an agreement with Moravia and use the situation in Dacia to regain the lost power?"
 MRU_VOX_MUNDI_DESC:0 "After Great Moravia had been split into several nations, its southern part has been beaten by its neighbors into irrelevancy. But now, if Dacia gets torn apart by inner conflicts, Moravia can finally have revenge on the bourgeoisie! it's our time to recreate Velka Moravia in all its glory and put the democracies into place!"
 FLE_VOX_MUNDI_DESC:0 "After several Great wars Ferraro-Lombard Empire is a shade of its former self, with rebellious Pisans and Ragusans creating their own little states on our land. But with democratic powers weakened we can act freely, and an alliance with Moravia would help with that!"
 KRE_VOX_MUNDI_DESC:0 "Korea can't directly participate in European conflicts, but if only Empire of the Everburning Sun becomes enemies with the democratic powers, we can enter the war and free Kirghiz, Chinese and Tibetans from the Mordvin menace."
 DAC_VOX_MUNDI_DESC:0 "Dacia has been fighting off rebellions for almost a century now, but this time, lacking a strong ruler, Dacia doesn't seem like it stands a chance against rebels sponsored by Dacia's mortal enemies."
 OTHER_VOX_MUNDI_DESC:0 "A Great War is not just a fight between 7 nations: all the nations of the world participate in it in one way or another."

 EES_VOX_MUNDI_DESC:0 "For the last several centuries, the once mighty Sibir has repeatedly lost to its neighbors, and were humiliated after losing a war against Korea. Now that we are surrounded by enemies, who can we rely on if a conflict arises?"
 AFR_VOX_MUNDI_DESC:0 "Ever since we were given independence by Great Baghdad, we wished for uniting the continent under one flag. Ever since the Revolution, we wished for peace and equality among all the ethnicities that constitute our nation. But now that the world is radicalised, can we manage to keep the African continent a peaceful place?"
 SEV_VOX_MUNDI_DESC:0 "Having been exiled from the Iberian peninsula, Seville has long dreamt of regaining control over the homeland. Now that Castille can't shield itself with Dacians, we have a chance!"
 LTH_VOX_MUNDI_DESC:0 "With Livonia and Prussia gaining independence, Fenno-Estonian uprisings and tensions with Turov, Lithuania has found itself in a precarious position. Should we try and find a compromise with the Gudians, or do we hold on to the democratic traditions till the very end?"
 UIW_VOX_MUNDI_DESC:0 "For centuries the Prophet's Land has been nothing but a sore rump state, having lost most of the land that historically belonged to us. However, with conflict brewing in Europe, we can remind the world about An Talamh Faithe!"
